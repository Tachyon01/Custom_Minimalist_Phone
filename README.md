# Custom_Minimalist_Phone
HackGT

## Inspiration
No modern phone allows one to integrate sensors and actuators of our choice.
And they all have so much distraction, hence back to basics:
Call, Text and on top of that , play with sensors


## What it does

## How we built it
Rpi mounted on a custom-designed PCB, with a 16x2 LCD, keypad buttons, and slots for sensors.
From designing the PCB to writing the OS for the product (which is a Python script running on RPi) is self-written from scratch.

## Challenges we ran into
The PCB machine was not working, so we ended up being limited to 1 side of the PCB, which forced us to cut some features planned earlier. The Display takes a lot of ports (because of a lack of better options). This made us cut some other features as well.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We finished a basic prototype of our device on a breadboard, with texting and sensor recognition working.

## What we learned
We attempted to manufacture a PCB version of this device, but we had a lot of trouble soldering and assembling the components. We also learned to take the feature addition step-by-step to ensure all parts are properly made.

## What's next for Custom-Built, no distraction Mobile Phone
Update the PCB to accommodate additional slots for IoT devices, manufacture a legitimate PCB that houses all the essential components, and add custom circuitry to make the phone more interactive, such as a biometric sensor and an audio speaker system.
